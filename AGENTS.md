# Streamline

## Stack

- **Language / Runtime**: TypeScript 5, Node.js 20+
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19
- **Key dependencies**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Radix UI, Lucide React
- **Package manager**: npm

## Build approach

Tracer Bullet (prove the whole pipe works end to end with a thin working thread before widening features).

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Dev server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Lint
npm run lint
```

## Specs

Stored in `docs/specs/`. Format: `docs/specs/NNNN-title.md`.

## Rules

- Server Components by default. Add `"use client"` only for interactive pieces.
- All mutations go through Server Actions or route handlers validating with Zod.
- Derive identity on the server from the session, never from client input.
- Every action and route handler authorizes first, then acts.
- Scope all database queries on workspace data by `workspaceId`.
- Never hand roll password hashing or sessions. Use Better Auth.
- Import shared instances from `src/lib/auth/` and `src/lib/db/`.
- Validate secrets in one env module, kept gitignored in `.env.local`.
- Wire data into existing Figma UI without changing layouts or animations.
- Run `npm run build` before considering any Server Action change verified (Vitest cannot catch Next.js "use server" export constraints).

_Drafted by /audit from the repo, worth a quick human pass. Edit freely: once a line stops matching this draft, later runs treat it as curated and will flag rather than overwrite it._

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
